I am currently a fellow of the AccelNet-MultiNet project. In addition to strengthening my relationships with peers in the US, I am actively participating in various events and meetings organized within the project.

The AccelNet-MultiNet program is an NSF-supported joint initiative led by the Network Science Institutes of Northeastern University (NetSI) and Indiana University (IUNI). Its purpose is to expand the international community engaged in scientific discovery and training related to the exploration of multilayer network science.
