I am currently collaborating with the IMMUNE project. My main role is to provide local support for Spanish experiments and data analysis.

The IMMUNE project will provide a ground-breaking interdisciplinary modelling framework that will explore the dynamics of human behavior on infectionsâ€™ spread, through the lens of social sciences, integrating risk perceptions on diseases and vaccines, (mis)information campaigns, social peers influence and digitalisation.
