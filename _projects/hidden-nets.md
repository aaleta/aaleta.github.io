I am the co-IP of the HIDDEN-NETS project, founded by funded by MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033.

This project is composed by several research lines, including the theoretical study of higher-order interactions in complex systems, the characterization of data-driven complex systems, and the study of emergent properties of AI models. Rather than isolating ourselves within individual fields, we recognize the power of collaboration, weaving together expertise from diverse domains to form a cohesive research team. Our shared vision revolves around a comprehensive understanding of complex systems.
