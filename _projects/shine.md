I was an external member of the COVID-SHINE project, which was jointly coordinated by the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems. I contributed my expertise in working with COVID-19 data to bridge the gap between epidemic modeling and the analysis of the social determinants of health.

The COVID-SHINE project was funded by the La Caixa Foundation and aimed to understand the spatio-temporal social determinants of health in order to improve agent-based modeling of recurrent COVID-19 outbreaks. The project had two main objectives: (1) enhancing the predictive capabilities of modeling strategies to understand the dynamics of recurring COVID-19 outbreaks by incorporating novel knowledge of the social determinants of health, and (2) developing an integrated systems framework to inform policies that prioritize reducing health inequalities.
