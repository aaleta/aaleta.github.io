I was a member of the team working on the KATY project at the University of Zaragoza. Our team utilized our expertise in network and systems biology to predict cellular and network perturbations based on transcriptomic data. We also specialized in integrating network methodologies with AI techniques.

The KATY project was funded by the European Union and aimed to develop an AI-empowered personalized medicine system. This system greatly assisted medical professionals and researchers in their daily work by providing easily understandable AI data at their fingertips. This next-generation technology bridged the gap between AI data and its application in the medical field, serving as a powerful tool in diagnosing, treating, and defeating serious illnesses. As a stress test, the KATY project initially experimented with data from patients diagnosed with a rare and complex form of kidney cancer.
