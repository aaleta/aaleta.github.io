In the Degree in Physics at the University of Zaragoza, I teach the courses:

- **Ordinary Differential Equations**: a second-year course that introduces students to the numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations, with applications in physics. For a nice introduction to the topic, I recommend the book [*Differential equations with boundary-value problems*](https://www.cengage.com/c/differential-equations-with-boundary-value-problems-10e-zill/9780357760451/) by  Dennis G. Zill.

 **Computational Physics**: a second-year course that covers various computational techniques and methods used in physics, including numerical integration, Monte Carlo methods, and simulations. You can find more information and resources [here](/teaching/computational-physics/).
 
I also coordinate the summer course *Introduction to Data Science* in Jaca (Spain) since 2023. Due to budget constraints, it is not offered every year. You can find more information about this and other summer courses [here](https://cursosextraordinarios.unizar.es/) (in Spanish).

Additionally, I provide academic advising to both undergraduate and graduate students. You can find more information about this [here](/teaching/academic-advising/).
