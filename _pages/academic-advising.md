I am the third year academic advisor for the Degree in Physics at the University of Zaragoza. To help me with this role, I have created some tools that may be useful for other advisors and students:

* [Reminders Bot](https://github.com/aaleta/bot_tutorial): A simple Telegram bot that sends you reminders at scheduled times. I use it to remind my students about deadlines.

* [Degree in Physics Dashboard]() (PENDING): A web application that provides an overview of the Degree in Physics program, including course offerings, average grades, and other relevant information to help students plan their academic path.
