## Tools

* [TODO list](https://github.com/aaleta/todo): My own customized version of the [Todo.txt utility](http://todotxt.org/) which allows you to keep track of your todo list directly from the terminal.

* [Reminders Bot](https://github.com/aaleta/bot_tutorial): A simple Telegram bot that sends you reminders at scheduled times. I use it to remind my students about deadlines.

* [Memes Bot](https://github.com/aaleta/bot_computacional): A Telegram bot that sends random memes (images) that I use in our Computational Physics class.

## Data

* [Hospital networks](https://github.com/aaleta/hospital_networks): networks used in the paper [Assessing the risk of spatial spreading of diseases in hospitals](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2022.882314)

## Coding
<div class="projects"><h2 class="category">C</h2></div>

* [COVID-19 modelling](https://github.com/aaleta/NHB_COVID): code for the baseline scenario from the paper [Modelling the impact of testing, contact tracing and household quarantine on second waves of COVID-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0931-9) and [Quantifying the importance and location of SARS-CoV-2 transmission events in large metropolitan areas](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2112182119).

* [Economy & COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7946867): code for the epidemic(C)-economic(Python) model used in the paper [The unequal effects of the health-economy tradeoff during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01747-x).

* [SIR model on a network with Gillespie algorithm](https://github.com/aaleta/sir_gillespie/): quick and dirty code to perform simulations of the SIR model on a network using Gillespie algorithm. Use at your own risk!
