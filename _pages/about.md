I am a data/network scientist currently working at the [Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI)](https://bifi.es/) at the University of Zaragoza, Spain. I would summarize my research interests simply by using the title of my Ph.D. thesis: "Networks, Epidemics, and Collective Behavior: From Physics to Data Science."

I enjoy all aspects related to data, from acquisition to visualization. Thus, it's challenging for me to focus on just one specific field. However, due to my background in physics, I am particularly interested in unraveling the mechanisms producing the data. Rather than solely focusing on finding correlations and making uninformed predictions, my aim is to understand the dynamic processes that generate it.

Additionally, I have a passion for computers and software engineering, which is why I recently finished a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. My final project was a Virtual Reality Golf Videogame set in space: [Astro Putt](https://github.com/aaleta/astro_putt).

Below, you will find my contact information if you'd like to chat. You can also check out my [publications](/publications) to see my works. I would also recommend visiting the [resources](/resources) section, which is currently brief, but I hope to expand it soon.
